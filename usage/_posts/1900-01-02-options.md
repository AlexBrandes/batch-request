title: options
---

In order to customize, rather than just immediately invoking the function exported by
**Batch Request** with no arguments, it's possible to pass in a JavaScript object representing any options
you'd like to add.

{% highlight bash %}
  // Instead of just getting the default options like so:
  var batch = require('batch-request')();

  // Specify them when this library is loaded like so:
  var options = {
      local_only: true,
      https_always: true
  };
  var batch = require('batch-request')(options);

  // Or as a shortcut:
  var batch = require('batch-request')({
      local_only: true,
      https_always: true
  });

{% endhighlight %}

Then when you use Batch Request, it will use thes options.

Available options:

* `local_only` - `true` or `false`. Defaults to `true`. If `true`, **batch request** will batch only local
  requests. This is the default in order to prevent the outside world from using this batch endpoint on
  your server as a proxy and making requests to other servers. If `false`, it will take any batch requests.
  Note: Do not set this to `false` unless you have other validation middleware in place to prevent nasty
  attacks.
* `https_always` - `true` or `false`. Defaults to `false`. If set to `true`, **batch request** will make
  force all requests over https even if the incoming object doesn't specify them as such.
* `max` - a number representing the largest batch size the middleware will accept. Defaults to `100`.
