title: options
---

In order to customize, rather than just immediately invoking the function exported by
**Batch Request** with no arguments, it's possible to pass in a JavaScript object
representing any options you'd like to add.

{% highlight bash %}
  // Get the default options
  var batch = require('batch-request')();

  // Specify that you only want max simultaneous requests at 5
  var batch = require('batch-request')({
      max: 5
  });
{% endhighlight %}

Then when you use Batch Request, it will use these options.

Available options:

| Option            | Notes                                                                                                                                   | Default |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `max`             | This is the maximum number of requests **Batch Request** will accept in one batch. Any more than this max will result in a `400` error. | `20`    |
| `validateRespond` | Whether or not to respond in the validation middleware. Setting to `false` leaves it up to you to respond.                              | `true`  |
| `allowedHosts`    | Array list of strings which represent allowed hosts. For example `['socialradar.com', 'localhost:3000']`. Must include port if used. If any request is not in the list of allowedHosts, the **Batch Request** validator will return a 400 error. | `null`  |


<!-- * `localOnly` - `true` or `false`. Defaults to `true`. If `true`, **batch request** will batch only local -->
<!--   requests. This is the default in order to prevent the outside world from using this batch endpoint on -->
<!--   your server as a proxy and making requests to other servers. If `false`, it will take any batch requests. -->
<!--   Note: Do not set this to `false` unless you have other validation middleware in place to prevent nasty -->
<!--   attacks. -->
<!-- * `httpsAlways` - `true` or `false`. Defaults to `false`. If set to `true`, **batch request** will make -->
<!--   force all requests over https even if the incoming object doesn't specify them as such. -->
