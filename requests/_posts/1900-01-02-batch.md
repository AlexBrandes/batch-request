To add more than one request, just add more keys to the root level JSON object, one per additional request:

{% highlight json %}
{
    "myRequest1": ...,
    "myRequest2": ...,
    "myRequest3": ...
}
{% endhighlight %}

This is 3 requests in one blob of JSON (with the request body replaced with `...` of course). The server will execute each request and send back a JSON object with the same keys and the results of each request as the value for each key.

Let's see an example more filled out. The JSON request we will `POST` to our endpoint using the **Batch Request** middleware:

{% highlight json %}
{
    "myRequest1": {
        "method": "GET",
        "uri": "/users/1/first_name"
    },
    "myRequest2": {
        "method": "GET",
        "uri": "/users/1/email"
    },
    "myRequest3": {
        "method": "GET",
        "uri": "/users/1/company"
    },
}
{% endhighlight %}

The response we receive:

{% highlight json %}
{
    "myRequest1": {
        "statusCode": 200,
        "body": "Victor",
        ...
    },
    "myRequest2": {
        "statusCode": 200,
        "body": "victor@socialradar.com",
        ...
    },
    "myRequest3": {
        "statusCode": 200,
        "body": "SocialRadar",
        ...
    },
}
{% endhighlight %}

Note I've omitted the rest of the request and replaced it with `...` because it's really large! It's the whole, unadulterated response object returned from [Request](https://github.com/mikeal/request) so to include the whole thing would make these docs far less readable.

*This assumes of course we have these three endpoints on our server, one each for name, email, and company on a user which each return simply a string. I question my own API design as rather silly!*
