To add more than one request, just add more keys to the root level JSON object, one per additional request:

{% highlight json %}
{
    "myRequest1": ...,
    "myRequest2": ...,
    "myRequest3": ...
}
{% endhighlight %}

This is 3 requests in one blob of JSON (with the request body replaced with `...` of course). The server will execute each request and send back a JSON object with the same keys and the results of each request as the value for each key.

Let's see an example more filled out. The JSON request we will `POST` to our endpoint using the **Batch Request** middleware:

{% highlight json %}
{
    "myRequest1": {
        "method": "GET",
        "uri": "http://api.mysite.com/users/1/first_name"
    },
    "myRequest2": {
        "method": "GET",
        "uri": "http://api.mysite.com/users/1/email"
    },
    "myRequest3": {
        "method": "GET",
        "uri": "http://api.mysite.com/users/1/company"
    },
}
{% endhighlight %}

The response we receive:

{% highlight json %}
{
    "myRequest1": {
        "statusCode": 200,
        "body": "Victor",
        "headers": {...}
    },
    "myRequest2": {
        "statusCode": 200,
        "body": "victor@socialradar.com",
        "headers": {...}
    },
    "myRequest3": {
        "statusCode": 200,
        "body": "SocialRadar",
        "headers": {...}
    },
}
{% endhighlight %}

Note, I've omitted the body of the headers as it's rather boring and not too helpful. But they'd all look something like this:

{% highlight json %}
{
    "x-powered-by": "Express",
    "content-type": "application/json; charset=utf-8",
    "content-length": "81",
    "date": "Mon, 16 Dec 2013 15:30:24 GMT",
    "connection": "keep-alive" 
}
{% endhighlight %}

I'll continue doing so throughout this documentation.

*This assumes of course we have these three endpoints on our server, one each for name, email, and company on a user which each return simply a string. I question my own API design as rather silly!*
