Here compiled are a series of the frequently asked questions about *requests*

**Q:** Does the key I pick matter?  
**A:** No! Pick any text string you want. It in no way effects how your request is handled. The one caveat is that you cannot send 2 requests with the same key, but otherwise the name will not affect how the request is handled.

**Q:** Does **Batch Request** support arbitrary nesting of requests?  
**A:** No. It expects a flat object. To model dependencies and other tiered requests, see our section on [dependency](#dependency) modeling.
