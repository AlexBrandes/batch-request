What follows below is a rather complex chaining. This is actually a real request
used in the unit tests of this module.

{% highlight json %}
{
    "time1": {
        "url": "http://api.mysite.com/users/1/hammertime"
    },
    "time2": {
        "dependency": "time1",
        "url": "http://api.mysite.com/users/1/delay"
    },
    "time3": {
        "dependency": "time2",
        "url": "http://api.mysite.com/users/1/hammertime"
    },
    "time4": {
        "dependency": "time1",
        "url": "http://api.mysite.com/users/1/delay"
    },
    "time5": {
        "dependency": "time4",
        "url": "http://api.mysite.com/users/1/delay"
    },
    "time6": {
        "dependency": "time4",

    },
    "time7": {

    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

**Batch Request** will ensure that all of the dependencies are met and things are run in the proper order.

*Unfortunately, **Batch Request** does not currently support multiple dependencies.*
