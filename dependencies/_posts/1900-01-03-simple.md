For this one of the request objects does not have any dependencies and the second is dependent on that one. 

{% highlight json %}
{
    "myRequest1": {
        "uri": "http://api.mysite.com/users/1/first_name"
    },
    "myRequest2": {
        "dependency": "myRequest1",
        "uri": "http://api.mysite.com/users/1/email"
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

As shown above, all that's necessary to ensure `myRequest2` runs after `myRequest1` is to provide the dependency key with a value which is the key of the request object on which it depends.
