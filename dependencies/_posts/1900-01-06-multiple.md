title: multiple
---

*Unfortunately, **Batch Request** does not yet support multiple dependencies.*

Support is planned, so you could say something like:

{% highlight json %}
{
    "time1": {
        "url": "http://api.mysite.com/users/1/hammertime"
    },
    "time2": {
        "url": "http://api.mysite.com/users/1/delay"
    },
    "time3": {
        "dependency": ["time1", "time2"],
        "url": "http://api.mysite.com/users/1/hammertime"
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

In such a case, `time3` would be dependent on both `time1` and `time2`.

Unfortunately this is not yet implemented. It gets a bit tricky as it's rather
easy to run into issues with circular dependencies, so we haven't tackled it
yet. We do have an app to launch ;)

Coming soon! *(sooner if someone else takes a crack at it and submits a pull request!)*
