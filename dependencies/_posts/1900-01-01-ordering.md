title: default ordering

So by now you may be thinking, batching is awesome and useful, but in what order are those requests performed?

Let's take the basic request from above:

{% highlight json %}
{
    "myRequest1": {
        "method": "GET",
        "uri": "/users/1/first_name"
    },
    "myRequest2": {
        "method": "GET",
        "uri": "/users/1/email"
    },
    "myRequest3": {
        "method": "GET",
        "uri": "/users/1/company"
    },
}
{% endhighlight %}

These 3 requests will all be run in parallel. We do this as it'll be the fastest for most use cases.

But what if you want these to run in series? What if you want `myRequest1` and `myRequest3` to run in parallel but `myRequest2` needs to wait for `myRequest1` to complete?

For example, let's say you want to create a User and create another item that depends on the existence of that user?

With the above simple pattern, nothing can be done, you'll have to do perform each of these requests in a separate API call as they all run in parallel.

*We have the technology. We can make it better. And we have.*

Enter, dependencies.
