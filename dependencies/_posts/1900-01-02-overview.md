We came up with a very simple and straightforward way of modeling almost any dependency imaginable on the client.

Essentially, for any series of requests, all the client needs to do in order to enforce an order is specify a dependency and **Batch Request** will handle all of the rest.

In more concrete terms, on any request you specify a key `dependency` and a value which is the string name of the request on which it depends.

For example, to specify that a User object must be created before a Device object is added for that user, I would specify `dependency: createUser` on the device.

This is best illustrated by example, so let's dive in.
