In order to ensure items run in series, simply flag each as a dependency of the previous:

{% highlight json %}
{
    "myRequest1": {
        "uri": "/users/1/first_name"
    },
    "myRequest2": {
        "dependency": "myRequest1",
        "uri": "/users/1/email"
    },
    "myRequest3": {
        "dependency": "myRequest2",
        "uri": "/users/1/company"
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Here since `myRequest3` has a dependency on `myRequest2` which has a dependency on `myRequest1` they will run in series, one before the next.
